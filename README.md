# React-Meals
A website created using react! It is a restaurant dummy website that allows the use to add and remove items to a cart to order! 
The main focus of this project was to practice React Hooks such as:
-useState
-useEffect
-useReducer
-useContext
-useRef

as well as using portals to create modals and have a tidier HTML.
