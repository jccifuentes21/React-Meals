# React-Meals
A website created using react! It is a restaurant dummy website that allows the use to add and remove items to a cart to order! 

The main focus of this project was to practice React Hooks such as:
-useState
-useEffect
-useReducer
-useContext
-useRef

as well as using portals to create modals and have a tidier HTML.

the use of forms and form validation, and http requests is also put into practice in this project.

The order is then sent to a firebase server where the data can be accessed by "the restaurant".
